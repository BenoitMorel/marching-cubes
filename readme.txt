Both CPU and GPU (with CUDA) implementations of the marching cube algorithm, along with an OpenGL viewer to display real time upates of the resulting mesh.

Marching cube core implementation: https://github.com/BenoitMorel/marching-cubes/blob/master/MarchingCubesGPU/src/kernel.cu
Interactive 3D viewer: https://github.com/BenoitMorel/marching-cubes/tree/master/OpenglViewer

Todo: recompile it to take a few screenshots!
